colour schemes
<!-- Primary Color: #3498db (Flat Blue)
     This is a classic, professional blue that is commonly associated with technology and trust. It's also easy on the eyes and works well for the main elements of your portfolio.

     Secondary Color: #2ecc71 (Emerald Green)
     Use this green as an accent color to add energy and a sense of innovation. It can be applied to call-to-action buttons, highlights, or other important elements to create visual interest.

     Background Color: #f8f8f8 (Light Gray)
     A light gray background helps improve readability and reduces eye strain. It also provides a clean and modern look, allowing the content and visuals to stand out.

     Text Color: #333333 (Dark Gray)
     Use a dark gray for text to ensure good contrast against the light background. It enhances readability and maintains a professional appearance.

     Accent Color: #e67e22 (Carrot Orange)
     Introduce this warm orange as an accent color to bring attention to specific details or interactive elements. It adds vibrancy without being too overpowering.
